# DBJoins
This Python script demonstrates querying and modifying a SQLite database using the built-in sqlite3 library. The database has three tables: Advisor, Student, and AdvisorStudent. The Advisor and Student tables have a one-to-many relationship, and the AdvisorStudent table serves as a junction table to create a many-to-many relationship.
